      "Hi, I'm Aaron Parecki, co-founder of IndieWebCamp. I maintain oauth.net, write about OAuth, and am the editor of the W3C Webmention and Micropub specifications, and co-editor of WebSub. I've been tracking my location since 2008, and write down everything I eat and drink. I've spoken at conferences around the world about owning your data, OAuth, quantified self, and explained why R is a vowel."
