      "Hi Barry!\nThank you for the response; to be honest, I'm struggling to get contacts to the Cambridge University, and right now I have even less chance in London. I'd only try London if Cambridge fails as an option.\nThe main reason for Cambridge & the University is that I'd like to get some of the students involved; they could then localize the idea and spread it in their native language, which, I believe, is a barrier for the indieweb at the moment.\nBut if you want to do one in London, I'd be happy to co-organize that :)"
