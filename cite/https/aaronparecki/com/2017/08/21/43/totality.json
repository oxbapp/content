      "Since I knew I wouldn't be able to get a good video/photo of the eclipse, and that plenty of other people would be taking good photos, I decided to make a video of all of us watching the eclipse instead! \n\nWe found a nice spot about 30 miles south of Portland, went with a group of 4, met up with 6 others, biked along with several hundred other bikers and landed at this riverbank as the eclipse was starting. \n\nThis video is from the ~5 minutes around the peak of the eclipse, sped up about 1000x because you really don't want to watch this in real time. We had about 45 seconds of total blackout at our location. I think my favorite part is the crazy sounds everyone made! Thanks to everyone who came along!\n\n#eclipse #eclipse2017 #biketheeclipse"
