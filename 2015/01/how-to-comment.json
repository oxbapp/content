      "You can comment on [any of the posts](/all) on this site using the [IndieWeb comment](http://indiewebcamp.com/comment) method. Here's how it's done.\r\n\r\n## Short version\r\n\r\n1. Publish a post on your own site with [Microformats 2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) markup. Use [h-entry](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry) for the content and [h-card](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card) for your profile.\r\n1. Link back to my post with `rel=\"in-reply-to\"`.\r\n1. Send a [Webmention](http://webmention.org) from your post to mine.\r\n1. I'll then parse your comment and display it below my post.\r\n\r\n## Longer version\r\n\r\n### Write \r\n\r\nPublish a post on your own site with [Microformats 2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) markup. You don't need any special software, just a tool that allows you to enter raw HTML.\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"h-entry\">\r\n      <div class=\"e-content\">I agree with you, Barry.</div>\r\n      <div class=\"p-author h-card\">John Smith</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n### Link back\r\n\r\nLink back to my post with `rel=\"in-reply-to\"`. This doesn't need to be part of the above h-entry, but should be placed somewhere on your post's permalink page.\r\n\r\n    <a href=\"https://barryfrost.com/2015/01/a-post\" rel=\"in-reply-to\">\r\n      A post about something important\r\n    </a>\r\n\r\nInstead of a comment you can alternatively indicate that you have **liked** or **reposted** my post by adding a `u-like-of` or `u-repost-of` to your link:\r\n\r\n    <a href=\"https://barryfrost.com/2015/01/a-post\" class=\"u-like-of\">\r\n      I liked this\r\n    </a>\r\n\r\n    <a href=\"https://barryfrost.com/2015/01/a-post\" class=\"u-repost-of\">\r\n      I reposted this\r\n    </a>\r\n    \r\n### Webmention \r\n\r\nFinally, send a Webmention from your post to mine to let me know you have a comment for me to retrieve.\r\n\r\nMy Webmention endpoint is: https://barryfrost.com/webmention. Send an HTTP POST to this URL with the following form variables (using your own URLs of course):\r\n\r\n- `source=https://example.org/my-reply`\r\n- `target=https://barryfrost.com/2015/01/a-post`\r\n\r\nYou can use one of [several clients](https://github.com/indieweb) to send your Webmention, but the simplest way to do this is via [curl](http://curl.haxx.se):\r\n\r\n    $ curl -i -d \"source=YOUR_POST_PERMALINK&target=MY_POST_PERMLINK\" \\\r\n    https://barryfrost.com/webmention\r\n\r\nIf your Webmention to me fails for any reason [let me know](/contact) and I'll be more than happy to help you debug.\r\n\r\n### Display\r\n\r\nIf successful, my server will parse your post, fetch your comment and add it below my original post."
