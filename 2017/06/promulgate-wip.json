      "I've been working on a [WebSub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/) hub called [Promulgate](https://github.com/barryf/promulgate). It's fairly basic and although it passes the [WebSub.rocks](https://websub.rocks) tests it needs a bit more polish. I'll probably also add background processing via Sidekiq so that publish requests aren't blocking."
