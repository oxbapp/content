It's a book and upcoming micro blogging platform (<a href=\"http://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a>) that dovetails neatly with my thoughts and work on the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org\">IndieWeb</a>. <br><br>As I've <a href=\"https://barryfrost.com/2016/01/i-m-excited-to-read-about\">noted before</a>, Manton aims to support many of the same technologies I've implemented on this site and I'm happy to support him in developing his platform. His vocal support for the IndieWeb is a welcome high-profile voice. Good luck, Manton.</div>"
