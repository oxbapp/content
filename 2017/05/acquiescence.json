      "html": "<div><a href=\"https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth\">IndieAuth</a> is a method for using your own domain name to sign in to other sites and tools. It’s one of the key parts of <a href=\"https://micropub.net\">Micropub</a>, the (newly) <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6326\">W3C recommended</a> standard for posting to your site. <a href=\"https://indieauth.com/\">IndieAuth.com</a> is the original and one of the very few public implementations of an IndieAuth server that you can use, but recently I’ve been having <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth.com/issues/148\">problems</a> getting it to work with my site’s SSL setup.<br><br>So I decided this was a good opportunity to try building my own IndieAuth <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/authorization-endpoint\">authorization</a> and <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/token-endpoint\">token</a>&nbsp;endpoints using the detailed documentation in the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org\">IndieWeb wiki</a>.<br><br>And <a href=\"https://github.com/barryf/acquiescence\">Acquiescence</a> is the result. It’s very simple (~160 lines of Ruby) and allows me to use my GitHub account to authenticate, authorise and grant scoped access to third-party tools like <a href=\"https://micropublish.net\">Micropublish</a>. I’m now using it for this site’s domain.<br><br>I’ve used my favourite stack of Ruby, Sinatra and Heroku for hosting, plus Redis to store the auths/tokens. The source code is available at: <a href=\"https://github.com/barryf/acquiescence\">https://github.com/barryf/acquiescence</a> if you want to poke around.</div><div><br></div>"
