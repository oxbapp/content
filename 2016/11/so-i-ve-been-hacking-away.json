      "So I've been hacking away for a couple of months but I think I'm almost there with my new personal website/engine.\r\n\r\nMy aim has been to rebuild to support the latest [Micropub draft specification](http://micropub.net/draft/), including full edits and deletes/undeletes via JSON, and pass the Micropub.rocks and Webmention.rocks test suites. \r\n\r\nI'm now at 100% for both and I suppose all that's left is to refactor a tiny bit, import my content, write it up and then push it live. It's tempting to keep tinkering but I think I'll learn more from selfdogfooding and getting it out in the wild. \r\n"
